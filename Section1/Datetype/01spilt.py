#.split() — The Divider
#The split() method breaks a single string into a list of smaller strings based on a specific separator.
#Primary Use: Breaking a sentence into words or parsing data from a list.

text = "Python is awesome"
words = text.split()
print("Words:", words)

text1 = "Python is fun"
print(text1.split()) 
# Output: ['Python', 'is', 'fun'] (It's now a list!)
