In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names. Here's a list of commonly used Python keywords with small examples for each:

1. if
Used for conditional statements.

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
2. else
Used with if to provide an alternative.

x = 2
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

3. elif
Short for "else if", used to check multiple conditions.

x = 5
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

4. for
Used for looping over a sequence.

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

5. while
Used for looping while a condition is true.

i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1

6. break
Used to exit a loop.

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

7. continue
Used to skip the rest of the loop and continue with the next iteration.

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

8. def
Used to define a function.

def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
greet()

9. return
Used to return a value from a function.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add(2, 3)
print(result)

10. class
Used to define a class in Python.

class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.bark()

11. import
Used to import modules.

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

12. try, except
Used for exception handling.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")

13. lambda
Used to create anonymous functions.

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))

14. pass
Used to skip a block of code.

def my_function():
    pass  # To be implemented later

15. with
Used to simplify exception handling when working with resources like files.

with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')

16. in
Used to check for membership in a sequence.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
if 3 in numbers:
    print("3 is in the list")

17. not
Logical NOT operator.

x = False
if not x:
    print("x is False")

18. and
Logical AND operator.

x = True
y = False
if x and not y:
    print("x is True and y is False")

19. or
Logical OR operator.

x = False
y = True
if x or y:
    print("At least one is True")

20. is
Used to check if two variables refer to the same object.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
if a is b:
    print("a and b refer to the same object")

21. None
Represents the absence of a value.

x = None
if x is None:
    print("x is None")
These are just a few examples of Python keywords, which help define the structure and control the flow of a program.
