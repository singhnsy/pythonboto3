In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't require you to explicitly declare the variable type, as it is dynamically typed.

Here are some common types of variables in Python with examples:

1. String Variable
A string variable is used to store a sequence of characters.

name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Output: Alice

2. Integer Variable
An integer variable stores whole numbers (positive or negative).

age = 25
print(age)  # Output: 25

3. Float Variable
A float variable stores decimal numbers.

height = 5.9
print(height)  # Output: 5.9

4. Boolean Variable
A boolean variable stores either True or False.

is_student = True
print(is_student)  # Output: True

5. List Variable
A list is a collection of items (can be of different types) that is ordered and changeable.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

6. Tuple Variable
A tuple is a collection which is ordered but immutable (cannot be changed).

coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates)  # Output: (10, 20)

7. Dictionary Variable
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, which is unordered, changeable, and indexed.

student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "major": "Computer Science"}
print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice

8. Set Variable
A set is a collection which is unordered and does not allow duplicate values.

unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

9. None Variable
None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.

result = None
print(result)  # Output: None

Local and Global Varaibles

Local Varaibles

1. 
def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")
my_function()

def addition():
    num1 = 40
    num2 = 30
    print ( num1 + num2)

addition()

def subs():
    num1 = 50
    num2 = 25
    print ( num1 - num2)

subs()

Global Varaibles
2. 
num1 = 100
num2 = 30

def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")
my_function()

def addition():
    num1 = 50
    num2 = 20
    print ( num1 + num2)

addition()

def subs():
    print ( num1 - num2)

subs()
